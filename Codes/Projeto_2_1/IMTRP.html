                        <p>The project aimed to develop an autonomous anti-collision and fall arrest cart with distance 
                            sensors controlled via arduino. The sensors were positioned in such a way that they prevent 
                            the robot from contacting obstacles in the direction of movement, such as walls, and also from 
                            falling from a certain altitude, for logistical use in industries, making a prototyping of modern 
                            vehicle models that do not need driver.

                                With the stabilization of 4.0 Industry in the brazilian parks
                                and international industrialists mainly in the
                                secondary sector of the economy, optimization became necessary
                                to all industrial pillars, which includes the sector
                                tertiary logistics services.
                                Globalization makes the market and the industry
                                are always looking to serve the customer as quickly as possible,
                                quickly and efficiently as possible, but for that it is necessary that
                                what is behind the implementation of these services
                                is providing security and efficiency with respect to
                                employees, that is, the use of equipment
                                definitive and increasingly improved.<br><br>
                                Thus, the purpose of this work was to
                                design and build a car that moves smoothly
                                independent, and who manages to avoid obstacles and who
                                stop him from falling into a hole, making a
                                simple simulation of independent vehicles for use
                                low-cost industrial and electrical.
                                Furthermore, the parody of a vehicle has not yet

                                    During the development of the project,
                                    software and hardware experiments were done in the prototype
                                    for a better understanding of the components used, such as the 
                                    ultrasonic sensor.
                                    In that regard, all the cart hardware was
                                    first stage completed, with a spike in difficulty
                                    only in doubt about the decision making of the position
                                    of the sensors in the chassis, which would better favor the detection
                                    of obstacles around the vehicle, having concentrated
                                    our efforts at the intersection of H bridge programming
                                    L298N, the 180° servo motor, and the ultrasonic sensors
                                    HC-SR04, by the Arduino platform.<br><br>
                                    The most pertinent challenge was to synchronize
                                    between the distance calculated by the sensor, so that the
                                    specimen could dodge obstacles and the speed
                                    with which he would stop engines A and B, and make the
                                    counterclockwise rotation of the same with the micro-servo motor,
                                    without having a very strong impact with the
                                    barriers.<br><br>
                                    Another problem was having to deal with the weight of the
                                    components, which made force for the deviation of the prototype
                                    for unwanted shortcuts. One issue analyzed was the
                                    stack issue, as there are many components connected
                                    in a single battery, which is 9V, consuming a lot of
                                    electricity and limiting the use of the project in
                                    in relation to their active time, being an alternative to
                                    use of a powerbank, which would increase the active time
                                    of the cart, but would reduce its speed and power.
                                    Furthermore, it was also difficult to deal with the
                                    question of time, speed, and height, which created danger
                                    of impact.

                                        At the end of september 2019 we were able to complete
                                        the prototype with almost 100% efficiency thanks to the
                                        horizontal sensor, althrough with low performance 
                                        in the vertical sensor, due to a lack of ultrassonic sensors sync.
                                        Even so, the robot can simulate a programmable autonomous industrial material transporter,
                                        wich could be used in industries for logistical facilities, helping to transport heavy metals, 
                                        people and preventing accidents that would cost employees lives in the work area.
