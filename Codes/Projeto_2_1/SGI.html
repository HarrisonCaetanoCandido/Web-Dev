                        <p>Socio-Geographic Isolation consists in the physical separation of populations by

                            or urban planning that can dificult basic access to the human rights.
                            This barriers create an information break and a lake of basic resources.

                                transport and health. The Data Sources were gathered from public databases, 
                                avaiable on the internet, so that we can observe how the three basic human rights 
                                were distribuited at state and national level.

                                        In Brazil there is a large area of ​​isolation in places
                                        rural areas because they are far from urbanization, and with the lack of
                                        transport many families and small entrepreneurs
                                        end up being isolated from the population itself, having
                                        difficulties in moving to the urban center and
                                        great difficulty in receiving food and medical assistance.
                                        In several cases, the residents of the region suffer from the
                                        lack of medical and school resources, losing the right
                                        of citizen.<br><br>
                                        In the IFSP-SJC campus, students have
                                        encountered difficulty with transport. for being a place
                                        where few people attend and for being in a
                                        Highway, public transport is restricted, where you have
                                        only one bus line, which ends up having a difficult
                                        access for people who come from all corners of the
                                        City. The only bus line that you have only goes through the
                                        center and few students manage to get it. This type
                                        problem affects the lives of many students, making
                                        with that many have to take at least two buses
                                        to go to school and causing physical and
                                        psychological.<br><br>
                                        In the country there are great inequalities regarding the area of
                                        education, as in neighborhoods far from the centers, and
                                        of urban and rural regions. An INEP study found
                                        that, in the age group of 10 to 14 years, 95% of young people in
                                        rural area, and 97% of young people in urban areas are located
                                        at Schools. The study also points out that 50% of
                                        urban children who attend schools
                                        are lagging behind in school. In rural areas, this
                                        situation affects 72% of students, thus revealing to have a
                                        discriminating delay, requiring the implementation
                                        of teaching programs capable of showing the actions
                                        of the state, taking into account the 1988 constitution. Or
                                        that is, the right to education is not only distant in the regions
                                        underprivileged as well as across the entirety of the
                                        National territory.<br><br>
                                        There are also regional inequalities in sanitation
                                        basic, whose importance is linked to systems that take care of
                                        water supply, sewage treatment
                                        and control of the destination of the garbage produced by the population,
                                        in order to promote hygienic and healthy habits,
                                        improvement of public cleaning and thus taking quality of
                                        life to the population. It is observed that the southeastern region of the country
                                        has better access to basic sanitation than the
                                        north and northeast regions

                                            basic sanitation, education and transport. There is still
                                            considerable differences between urban and rural regions, and
                                            central and peripheral neighborhoods in urban areas.
